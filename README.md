iÂ´ll write a frontend page that can handle the contract using this idea i wrote down:## simple frontend
create a simple frontedn for the contract.
add price feed api with real time price update for USD/ETH on polygon chain in a container. add a input field for the user to enter the price of $USD/ETH on a specific date and time pre defined by the frontend. add five blue buttons named button1, button2, button3, button4, button5. representing 4 weeks, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 7 days, and 4 days in the future under the container on one line left to right. 

when a user clicks abuton for example 4 weeks in future button4, the user is prompted to enter the price of $USD/ETH on that specific date and time pre defined by the frontend.

add a green button for the user to submit the prediction.

the submited prediction will register the exact timestamp and price of $USD/ETH on that specific date and time qnd also the prediction 4 weeks in the future. and same for the other buttons but with ther respective values
