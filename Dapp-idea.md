this is a contract idea i got. can you help me write a contract based on the idea:## Contract Idea
This contract is a betting pool where participants wager 1 MATIC on their prediction of the future price of $USD/ETH. using chainlink oracles price data. The prediction can be for 4 weeks, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 7 days, or 4 days into the future.

If a participant correctly predicts the price 4 weeks in advance, they receive 90% of the pool. If no one correctly predicts the price 4 weeks in advance, the pool remains and 75% of the initial pool is paid out to the participant who correctly predicts the price 3 weeks in advance. This process continues for each subsequent time period if no correct prediction is made.

In the event that two or more participants predict the exact same correct price, the winning pot is split evenly among them.
